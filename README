nostr-rtr
=========

A simple nostr relay-to-relay bridge.

So what was basically this thing doing?

Relay 1   <--- Events ---
  |                     |
  --- Events --->   Relay 2

Syncing all events including realtime to two (or more) relays.


First time using
================
Please run `npm install`.


So how to use this?
===================

Say, you would like to relay wss://relay1.example.com with your relay that were listening at localhost. 

~/nostr-rtr $ node rtr.js wss://relay1.example.com ws://localhost:8080

And now feel free to browse, or post stuffs to wss://localhost:8080.
